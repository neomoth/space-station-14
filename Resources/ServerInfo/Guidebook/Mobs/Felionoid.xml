  A smaller feline species that is light on their feet.
  
  ## Racial Features
  Their unarmed claw attacks deal [color=red]3[/color] points of Slash damage with a hit rate that is [color=yellow]2[/color] times faster than humans.

  Additionally, Felionoids can run [color=lightgreen]25%[/color] faster than humans but are more vulnerable:
  - They fall into a critical state at [color=red]75[/color] points of damage.
  - They die at [color=red]150[/color] points of damage.

  ## Weapon Knockback
  Felionoids will find that large caliber weapons will push them around. They receive [color=yellow]Stun Damage[/color] for every shot fired from a large caliber weapon.
  
  In general, the weapons that will give you knockback are [color=yellow]Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, LMGs, HMGs, and Grenade Launchers.[/color]

  Look out especially on Rocket launchers, as since they are recoilless, you will actually get [color=red]pulled forward with the rocket[/color] for a short distance.
  - The safest weapons to use that will give you no knockback are [color=green]Pistols and SMGs[/color].
  - No slips can help mitigate some of the knockback from firing weapons, but not all of it!
  - Also keep in mind that any stamina resistance you have DOES work to reduce the stamina damage from these weapons.
