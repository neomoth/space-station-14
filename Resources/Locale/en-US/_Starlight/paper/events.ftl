[italic][mono]Greetings, station, we write bearing good news
It seems that we have accidentally sent you
to a station deep in NT aligned space, and as 
such, you are unlikely to face any threats for
the duration of this shift.

We have sent you the credits for a pizza party 
to celebrate this happy accident![/mono][/italic]

[italic]Warning. Failure to acknowledge an official Central Command communication message may lead to immediate termination of your contract.[/italic]
