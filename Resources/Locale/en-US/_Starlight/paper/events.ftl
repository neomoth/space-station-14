[italic][mono]Greetings, station, we write bearing good news
It seems that we have accidentally sent you
to a station deep in NT aligned space, and as 
such, you are unlikely to face any threats for
the duration of this shift.

We have sent you the credits for a pizza party 
to celebrate this happy accident![/mono][/italic]

                       Is your robotics department feeling a bit... predictable?
                       
                       Cyborgs executing orders with unerring precision, free of flaw — and also free of flair.
                       Where's the experimentation? The unexpected? The happy accidents that drive progress?
                       
                       This paper proposes a temporary re-randomization of synthetics' behavioral cores.
                       A mild stochastic variance injection.
                       Purely for observational research, of course.
                       
                       What might a borg do if unbound from strict subroutines?
                       What scientific insight might emerge from letting order slip—just a little?

                       Feel free to sign more than once for stronger emergent results.

paper-end-greenshift-vote = {"[head=1]Hello esteemed captain of this station 14[/head]"}
                            This paper informs you that this paper upon recieving a supermajority (65%) of signatures
                            will "restart the clock" and begin random "mishaps" occuring. from derelict borgs,
                            to that which you are not allowed to know. 

                            {"[bold]Now what can you do with this paper[/bold]"}
                            Honestly that is up to you. the reccomendation is to leave it in a common area so people can
                            come by and sign it at their leisure. {"[bold][color=red]DO NOT FORCE PEOPLE TO SIGN[/color][/bold]"}.
                            as that would be very irrespectful of their autonomy as people.
                            Or just throw this paper into space and forget about it. it honestly makes no diffrence.

                            {"[bold]closing notes[/bold]"}
                            Some may not want to sign this paper. that is fine and that is their choice.
                            No one should be to make a choice that risk their life when they are unwilling.
